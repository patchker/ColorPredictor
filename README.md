###Predictive Models for gambling site for my own usage

This repository contains the implementation of various predictive models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for predicting the next color in a popular online gambling site.

#Prerequisites
The script requires Python 3.6+ and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Selenium
Scikit-Learn
BeautifulSoup

Also, you need to have the webdriver for your preferred browser.

#Usage
First, replace driver_path = "path/to/chromedriver" with the correct path to your webdriver in the main section of the code. This script opens a Selenium WebDriver to scrape gambling website, gets the history of previous colors, and then uses the predictive models to predict the next color.

The script features 4 different prediction models:

knn_predict(numbers): K-Nearest Neighbors. Prints the predicted color.
random_forest_predict(numbers): Random Forest. Prints the predicted color.
svc_predict(numbers): Support Vector Machine. Prints the predicted color.
gradient_boosting_predict(numbers): Gradient Boosting. Prints the predicted color.

#Note
Gambling is addictive and can lead to severe losses. This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.
